# Introduction

Electroneum uses a cryptographically sound system to allow you to send and receive your tokens without your transactions being easily revealed on the blockchain. This ensures that all token transfers remain absolutely private by default, but if necessary, can be proven to a third party by providing specific keys.

**Security:** Using the power of a distributed peer-to-peer consensus network, every transaction on the network is cryptographically secured. Individual wallets have a 25 word mnemonic seed that is only displayed once, and can be written down to backup the wallet. Wallet files are encrypted with a passphrase to ensure they are useless if stolen.

Electroneum (and its group companies) have separately developed proprietary software which can be used in conjunction with this project. This software is subject to separate terms and conditions which are available at https://electroneum.com .

# About this Project

This is the core implementation of Electroneum. It is open source and completely free to use without restrictions, except for those specified in the license agreement below.

The V8 software upgrade (Electroneum v3.0.0.0 release) introduced some fairly radical changes to the Electroneum blockchain, those consisting on a new consensus algorithm we’ve coined as **Proof of Responsibility** and change from a full permission-less blockchain to a **Moderated Blockchain**.

A **Moderated Blockchain**, powered by the **Proof of Responsibility** consensus algorithm, allow Electroneum Ltd to have more control over the blockchain while keeping a good degree of decentralization. This ultimately improves our security while making the blockchain’s commercial & economic model more attractive. Besides these main features, we’ve included a few minor changes that contributes to the blockchain’s operability and scalability.

# Development Resources

As with many development projects, the repository on Github is considered to be the "staging" area for the latest changes. Before changes are merged into that branch on the main repository, they are tested by individual developers in their own branches, submitted as a pull request, and then subsequently tested by contributors who focus on testing and code reviews. That having been said, the repository should be carefully considered before using it in a production environment, unless there is a patch in the repository for a particular show-stopping issue you are experiencing. It is generally a better idea to use a tagged release for stability.

**Anyone is welcome to contribute to Electroneum's Desktop Wallet codebase!** If you have a fix or code change, feel free to submit it as a pull request directly to the "master" branch. In cases where the change is relatively small or does not affect other parts of the codebase it may be merged in immediately by any one of the collaborators. On the other hand, if the change is particularly large or complex, it is expected that it will be discussed at length either well in advance of the pull request being submitted, or even directly on the pull request.

# Vulnerability Response Process

HackerOne is a vulnerability coordination and bug bounty platform that connects businesses with penetration testers and cybersecurity researchers. It was one of the first companies, along with Synack and Bugcrowd, to embrace and utilize crowd-sourced security and cybersecurity researchers as linchpins of its business model; it is the largest cybersecurity firm of its kind. As of July 2018, HackerOne's network consisted of approximately 200,000 researchers, had resolved 72,000 vulnerabilities across over 1,000 customer programs, and had paid $31 million in bounties.
